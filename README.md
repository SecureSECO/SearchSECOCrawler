# Crawler

The Crawler is responsible for finding projects to process, scouring different code sources and returning found URLs. These URLs are then processed by the Spider. Another important function of the Crawler is to retrieve project-specific metadata, like the name and email of the owner of the project.

# Installation

Download the .zip containing the source files and extract the files.
## Dependencies

* c++14 or c++17
## Building

The project can be build by opening the solution file and building via Visual Studio 2019. This will result in multiple files including a library of the project.
# Usage

## Library

The Crawler has two entry points. The function _crawlRepositories_ returns a list of URLs given a crawlable source (either GitHub or GitLab), while the _findMetadata_ function returns project metadata of a given project URL.
